This release completes the deployment access token feature.

## New: Deployment Access Token

Deployments can now perform API calls to Platz:

* Read operations (GET) are allowed for every object in Platz, regardless of its env.
* Mutating operations (POST, PUT, DELETE) are allowed for objects in the same env as the deployment.

### How Deployment Credentials Work

The way this works is by Platz creating and maintaining a secret named `platz-creds` in the deployment namespace. The secret contains an access token valid for one hour, and it's refreshed every 30 minutes.

The k8s-agent worker is responsible for refreshing these secrets, so the credentials become invalid if the worker is not running for any reason.

### Using Deployment Credentials

To use the `platz-creds` secret it has to be mapped in each pod that needs to communicate with Platz.

The Platz URL is injected into the chart values when installing under `platz.own_url` and can be passed as an environment variable to the pod as well.

For example, this pod template can be used in a Helm chart deployed from Platz:

``` yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  containers:
    - name: example
      image: ubuntu:latest
      command:
        - /bin/sleep
        - "100000000"
      env:
        - name: PLATZ_API_TOKEN
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: platz-creds
              key: access_token
        - name: PLATZ_URL
          value: {{ .Values.platz.own_url }}
```
