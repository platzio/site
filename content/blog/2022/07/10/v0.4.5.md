## Added `server_url` and `expires_at` to `platz-creds` secret

The `platz-creds` secret injected into each deployment namespace now contains two new properties:

* `server_url` with Platz's URL
* `expires_at` for when the credentials expire and should be refreshed, in ISO 8601 format

These changes are also applied in the Rust SDK version `0.4.3`.

To use the injected secret, run a deployment with the `platz-creds` secret mounted like so:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: ...
          volumeMounts:
            - name: platz-creds
              mountPath: "/var/run/secrets/platz"
              readOnly: true
      volumes:
        - name: platz-creds
          secret:
            secretName: platz-creds
            optional: false
```
