## Changed: Helm Chart `api.oidc`

The `api.oidc` section in Platz's Helm chart values was moved to `auth.oidc`.

## New: Admin Emails

Thanks a lot to @vmalloc for [reporting this issue](https://github.com/platzio/backend/issues/24)!

This allows for specifying email addresses of users that will automatically get an admin role when logging into Platz.

The main use for this is in new installations.

New users that are successfully identified against the OIDC provider are created as admins if their email is in the admins list.

After installing a new Platz installation and logging-in, the admin emails can be safely removed.

If the admin emails are left as they are and a user is demoted to a regular user role, they will never become admins using this mechanism. Only another admin can promote them to become admins again.

### Admin Emails in Helm Chart

To specify admin emails in the Helm chart, pass the email addresses to `auth.adminEmails`:

```yaml
# values.yaml

auth:
  adminEmails:
    - alice@example.com
    - bob@example.com
```

### Admin Emails in Terraform

The Terraform main module gets an `admin_emails` variable as a `list(str)` type.

``` hcl
module "platz" {
  ...
  admin_emails = [
    "alice@example.com",
    "bob@example.com",
  ]
}
```
