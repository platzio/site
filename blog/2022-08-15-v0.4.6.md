## API Changes

The APIs for Helm registries and charts can now filter by these properties:

* `/api/v2/helm-charts` with `?in_use=true` returns all Helm charts currently in use and their potential upgrades.
* `/api/v2/helm-reegistries` contains the `kind` property for each registry. Registries can also be filtered by their `kind`.

## Frontend Improvements

The frontend uses the API improvements mentioned above to initially load much faster: Instead of loading all Helm charts, the frontend loads only charts in the use and upgrade candidates.

When navigating to a page that requires all charts from a registry/kind the frontend fetches those specifically. For example, this happens when creating/editing a deployment.

## `platz` Section

When deployment a chart, the `platz` section injected into the chart's values now contains the full cluster object as it would be returned from the API.

This is useful when cluster properties such as its domain are needed during deployment.
